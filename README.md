Android App - Number Guessing Game
Pick a number between the min and max and keep it in mind. Now press start and the app tries to guess which number you picked. If it didn't get it right, choose whether your number was lower or higher than the number showed. If it is correct, the computer won! After a number of rounds of guessing, the computer will concede.
